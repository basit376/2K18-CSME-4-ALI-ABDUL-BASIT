<h3>Introduction: </h3>
  He work on the Energy smells are of the presence of poor implementation choices that badly affects energy consumption in (Android Studio) mobile applications. firstly he compared to famous Detection  tools aDoctor and Paprika that are already avaliable he work on aDoctore and extend aDoctor architecture as automation refactoring and publish on android studio.
<h3>Research: </h3>
   He Work on 5 Major energy smells issues 1: Durable Wakelock  2: INFFICIENT DATA STRUCTURE 3: LEACKING THREAD 4: MEMBER IGNORING METHOD 5: INTERNAL SETTER
<h3>Methodology: </h3>
  Adoctor tool first analyze the mobile applications then it proposes a refactoring solution for each detections and then the user agree it applies Refactoring automatically:
<h3>Summary</h3>
   This tool first extract abstract syntax trees  from the source code then relying Eclipse JDT Code library it analyzes  andry factors the code directory on extracted syntax trees finally the changes are propagaded to source code  Adoctor tool can find and fix different energy smells durable  1: Durable Wekelock  2: INFFICIENT DATA STRUCTURE 3: LEACKING THREAD 4: MEMBER IGNORING METHOD 5: INTERNAL SETTER 6:EARLY RESOURCE BINDING
<h3>MOTIVATION: </h3>
  WE CAN CREATE A AUTOMATIONS TOOLS AND PUBLISH FOR PEOPLE THEY USE IT AND SAVE HIS/HER TIME IN FINDING ERRORS IN THEIR CODES:
<h3>Results: </h3>
  
WE GET IT VERY USE FOR DEVELOPER TO USE Adoctor tool to refactoring automatically these 6 major energy smell  components in java mobile applications codes:

<h3>Introduction: </h3>
 he work on Rotten Green tests are passing tests  which have at least one assertion not executed and rotten test give developers a false confidence the he present RTj a frame work tool
 <h3>Methodology: </h3>
 A rotten  green  test is a tests contains assertions that are never executed and rotten test giving developers a false confidence because beyond  passing an assertion that should validate some property is in fact not executed for helping java developers to detect green test and create a framework called RTj RTj needs to run on java virtual machine 8 Moreover Maven must be installed on your machines and accesible     from  command  line in analysis of any project RTj can analyze any kind of Java project, not necessary Maven project. For that, it will be necessary to pass (via command line arguments) to RTj additional information about the project under analysis. As by default, RTj calls project-info-maven-plugin, to disable this feature, pass the argument autoconfigure false. Then, use the following arguments to pass the information related to the project to analyze. -location "absolute location of the project to analyze" 

-dependencies "folder with the dependencies of the application to analyze" 

-javacompliancelevel "compliance level of source code

-srcjavafolder "source code folder"

-srctestfolder "test source code folder"

-binjavafolder "class folder"

-bintestfolder "test class folder" 

 <h3>MOTIVATION: </h3>
 work for detecting and refactoring smelly test. :    We can see that Rotten Green tests can give false confidence in testing their  projects and RTj give automatic solution to developer for thier projects and we provide developer a unified frame work for detecting and refactoring smelly test.
<h3>Results: </h3>
The Main Result of this paper RTj a frame work that analyzes statically and dynamically test cases with the goal of detecting smelly test including rotten test cases rotten test give devlopers to false confidence and RTj give helping to developers automatically detect
